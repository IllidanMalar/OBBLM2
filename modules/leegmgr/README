LEEGMGR

Configuration

The settings.php file is the only configurable file for LEEGMGR.  The settings are straight forward and look like this:

    $settings['leegmgr_enabled']  = true;   // Enables upload of BOTOCS LRB5 application match reports.
    $settings['leegmgr_schedule'] = true;   // Uploads report to a scheduled match.  The options are [false|true|"strict"]
                                            // false does not check for scheduled matches
                                            // true checks for scheduled matches and will create a match if not found
                                            // "strict" will allow only scheduled matches to be used
    $settings['leegmgr_extrastats'] = true; // Enables the reporting of extra stats and the use of the alternate XSD file.
    
The leegmgr_extrastats settings requires that the BOTOCS install is using the template_eps.xml file.
The easiest way to set this up is to:
1. Delete <BOTOCS>\template\default.xml.
2. Copy template_eps.xml to <BOTOCS>\template.
3. Rename <BOTOCS>\template\template_eps.xml to default.xml.
    
Using LEEGMGR

After the coaches play a match in BOTOCS, the result file is created as <BOTOCS>\results\OrcsWood.zip.
The team names are shortened to 4 characters each.

Upload the results zip file:
1. Click Plugins.
2. Click BOTOCS match report upload.
3. Click Browse.
4. Browse to the results zip file and click open.
5. Choose the "Free for All" match from the drop down menu that the report should go to.
6. Click Send File.

You can now view the match report as a normal OBBLM match.  The replay file for the match is available on that page.

LRB6 for BOTOCS
To configure BOTOCS for LRB6 copy rules-LRB5-Experimental.xml to the <BOTOCS>\rules folder, overwriting the existing file.
Using the same name is the easiest way as the path to the default rules is hard coded.
